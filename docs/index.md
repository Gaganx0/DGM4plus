# DGM⁴+ Challenge on Global Scene Inconsistency Detection
### PP-MisDet Workshop @ CVPR 2026

DGM⁴+ is a benchmark and challenge for detecting **semantic and narrative inconsistencies** in image–caption pairs, with a focus on **global scene plausibility** and multimodal misinformation.

---

## Motivation

Modern misinformation increasingly relies on **contextual manipulation**, where realistic foregrounds are combined with misleading backgrounds and deceptive captions.

DGM⁴+ moves beyond low-level artifact detection and emphasizes **scene-level reasoning and narrative coherence**.
