# Baselines

We recommend including at least 1–2 runnable baselines so participants can onboard quickly:

## Baseline ideas
- CLIP-style image–text similarity as a global consistency signal
- Vision-only features for FG vs BG mismatch scoring
- Multimodal LLM prompting (binary plausibility)
- Any local manipulation detector baseline (to show failure modes on FG–BG)

## What to include
- code links
- expected numbers (even approximate)
- runtime + hardware notes
