# Evaluation

## Task
Binary prediction: **consistent** vs **inconsistent** image–caption pair.

## Metrics (typical)
Pick and publish what your leaderboard uses:
- Accuracy
- Macro-F1 (or binary F1)
- AUROC (if confidence scores are required)

## Optional: explanations (not scored)
Submitters may optionally provide:
- image grounding (boxes/masks/heatmaps)
- highlighted caption spans

We may feature strong explainability outputs in workshop presentations.
